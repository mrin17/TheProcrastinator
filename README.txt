The dist/TheProcrastinator.jar is what you should run

Briefing:
Hi, we’re designing a new scheduling app called the Procrastinator that will help you organize all of your tasks. You can create tasks, set times for tasks, and procrastinate if you think you will not be able to finish your work today. It is going to be a phone application.

We are conducting a study to find out what people think about this. We will not record or publish any information with your name. This is for a course we’re taking in Human-Computer Interaction from Prof. Bickmore in the College of Computer and Information Science. Your participation is voluntary and you can stop anytime and ask that your data not be used. It should take about 20 minutes and we will compensate you with a candy bar. Can you help us with this?

Great. As I mentioned, we’re working on a scheduling app. We want you to help us figure out how to make this app interface more user-friendly before we finish developing it. We’ve created paper versions of the screens, and this guy named (Terry\Luke) will be playing the phone.

We’ll give you some tasks that we think represent what people might do in real life with the app, such as setting times for tasks, rescheduling tasks, and more. You should tell us what makes sense, what’s confusing, whether it works the way you’d expect it to or not. We need feedback or else the app will not get better. The other members of the team will just be watching and quietly taking notes.

Keep in mind that we’re testing the interface--we’re not testing you—so if you run into any problems it’s our fault and not yours. I’ll be sitting next to you, and I can help you if you want. The prototype still has some rough edges (that’s why it’s paper) —we’re still thinking through how it should work and some parts of it are incomplete. Before we cast it in concrete, we want to get some feedback about how well this design works.

(Terry/Luke) here will be playing the phone. He has no speech recognition and no artificial intelligence. Thus, he cannot explain anything. If you want to do something, you’ll need to interact with the prototype just as you would on a phone. Use your finger to touch buttons. If you think there is a field that you need to enter data in, just touch the field. Please don’t write on this, but you can write on the small paper pieces that are for data entry.

Please tell us what makes sense to you, what’s confusing, and any questions that come to mind. It is important that you talk while you are using the interface so that we know what you think of it. Your questions are especially valuable, but I may not answer them right away because our goal is to change the interface so it answers them. Remember again that we’re testing the interface—we’re not testing you. Are you ready to start?

OK, here’s the first task. Take a minute to read it and ask me questions about it. Whenever you’re ready, you can begin to show us what you would do first.


Here are the 3 tasks that you will be performing. 
For ease of use, use what you created from task 1 in task 2, and use task 2 for task 3:

1)	Create a 2 hour task called “HCI Project” due on Friday, November 14th at 1:00am. Schedule this for today at 3pm. Create a 1-hour task called "Capstone Homework" due on Saturday, November 15th at 1:00am. Also schedule this for today, but at 8pm.

2)	Procrastinate, then reschedule your “Capstone Homework” task to 1pm-2pm on Friday, November 14th. After that, reschedule your “HCI Project” task to 10am-12pm on Wednesday, November 12th. 

3)	Change your “HCI Project” task’s due date from Friday, November 14th, to Monday,November 17th. Then set that task to 50% completion. Then, set your “Capstone Homework” task’s completion percentage to 100%.
